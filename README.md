# Sentiment Analysis using Deep Neural Network and Python.

I trained three different neural networks for this project: a Long Short-Term Memory neural network, a Convolutional Neural Network, and a Simple Neural Network. Our trained Sentiment Classification LSTM Model can accurately predict the user's sentiment regarding a movie review, identifying it as positive or negative, and also predicts the IMDb rating that corresponds with these reviews.
